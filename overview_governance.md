Overview of governance models
=============================

This document is an overview of different governance structure with a special focus on those relevant for refactoring a small company into an open decentralized autonomous organization.


Definitions
-----------
*Governance* refers to "all of processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization or territory and whether through the laws, norms, power or language. (Bevir, 2013)" In particular Governance goes beyond the body of legal texts governing various organizations. It also includes the application of these laws to the real world, with all the social aspects involved in concretely enforcing a common set of rules.

An *Enterprise Governance System* is about the organization of 
- 1. Power - decision processes (mainly about resources allocations and value repartition / negociations, regulations, ...) : how it is run (headed / shared) and 
- 2. Control (about performance measurement, information management... might be wider than financial)

both formal or informal (processes, rules, interpersonnal relations, ...)

"made of 2 elements : the institutional and regulatory environment and the "Corporate Control Mix""
Carati and Tourani Rad, (1999) 




A typology of organizational governance
---------------------------------------
The following is largely based on chapter 2 of Mark Bevir's 'Governance: a very short introduction', 2013.

This chapter focuses on the three main concepts underpinning ‘Organizational governance’: hierarchies, markets and networks.

#### Hierarchies
##### Definition
Hierarchies have a pyramidal structure converging to a central authority which presides over a tree of subordinates units. The employees of such organizations are to obey their boss, and command over their subordinates. Hierachies are often found in private companies and public bureaucracy.

##### Characteristics
- Works best when the organization has a clear purpose.
- Encourage division of labour and specialization.
- Management is crucial.
- Employees have to follow the rules.

##### Pros
- Can handle complicated tasks.
- Clear accountability.
- Formal rules are a barrier to corruption and official bias.

##### Cons
- Unresponsive and inefficient because of different goals between bosses and employees. See Frederic Lordon's alpha angle.
- Vital need of clear criteria of success. Bosses need to evaluate / supervise
- Flexibility is made difficult by outdated rules.

#### Markets
The market is a (virtual) place where buyers and sellers exchange goods (especially money). They organize the collaboration of several parties with little contact. This organizational mechanism is not applicable to all decisions but works well for some of them.

##### Characteristics
- Decentralized structure.
- Prices are central in Markets. They gather a lot of information about a deal.
- Dynamical principles underlying prices: supply and demand

##### Pros
- No need to know or even see the other to sign a deal.
- Fosters competition.
- Provide high degree of coordination without supervision.

##### Cons
- Can be undermined by monopolies and cartels.
- Prices and competition do not apply to everything.
- There are market crisis.

#### Networks
"Networks consist of multiple actors who are formally separate but depend on one another for key resources and so build long-term relationships to exchange resources."

##### Characteristics
- Presupose and develops high level of trust between actors.
- Can be decentralized (not necessarily).

##### Pros
- Reliable and efficient flow of information.
- Useful for mobilizing actors and promoting change.
- Good for interdisciplinary and creative work.

##### Cons
- Lack of stability. A break of trust can kill a network.
- Sometimes inflexible because too complicated. One person cannot change anything major.
- No accountability.  Leads to the emergence of untouchable dominant selfish behaviors.

| Culture                            | Subordination    | Competition                   | Reciprocity           |
	
Application to real life
------------------------
Of course any real organization will involve a mixture of the three categories weather they want it or not. In today's world, an organization interact with the job markets to get members, it also often exists with a global market with a lot of competitors. Besides, the hierarchical system is widespread at least in the mindset of members.

But as seen earlier there are various pros and cons for each type of organization and it could be interesting to design a system which gets the most out of each of them.

TODO: examples of organization (coorporations, associations, states) and how they implement hierarchies, merkets and networks.

#### Holacracy
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy).
[Zappos](https://www.zapposinsights.com/about/holacracy) claims to be implementing holacracy.


#### Futarchy
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy).
The prediction markets [Augur](https://www.augur.net/) and [Gnosis](https://groupgnosis.com/) can be seen as fundamental elements of a futarchy.

Ralph Merkle outlines in [this paper](http://merkle.com/papers/DAOdemocracyDraft.pdf) ideas to apply futarchy as a way to "fix" democracy. He belives that prediction markets, better than voting systems, could yield higher welfare notably on the longer term.

#### Stakeholders / Shareholders governance systems? 
See gouvernance partenariale : 
"Les  travaux  en  gouvernance  partenariale  inscrits  dans  la  théorie positive  de  l’agence  (Jensen et Meckling 1976, 1992) appréhendent l’organisation comme un système contractuel coopératif   où   interagissent   différents   partenaires   aux   intérêts divergents.   Supposant   l’existence  de  conflits  entre  cocontractants  parmi  lesquels  agit  le  dirigeant,  cette  approche propose une   analyse   du   fonctionnement   organisationnel   à   partir des   mécanismes   de  gouvernance. Les parties prenantes s’appuient contractuellement ou non sur ces derniers afin de  discipliner  ou  d'infléchir  le  comportement décisionnel  du  dirigeant. L’entreprise  est  considérée comme un ensemble de contrats, et de mécanismes de gouvernance permettant la sauvegarde des intérêts de chacune des parties prenantes, de les aligner et d'atténuer leur perte d’utilité  respective" in (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Celine_Chatelin/publication/255645966_Stabilit_et_volution_du_cadre_conceptuel_en_gouvernance_d'entreprise__un_essai_de_synthse/links/5440edf40cf228087b69a17d.pdf)

#### Delegative democracy
Also called liquid democracy. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy).
[Liquid feedback](http://liquidfeedback.org/) is an implementation mainly used in Germany.

#### Democracy
[Groupe Hervé](http://www.groupeherve.com/organisation-participative/intelligence-collective) works with internal democratic rules and network organization from years

#### Strawman Democracy
[DemocracyOS](http://democracyos.org/) is a software which let militant vote for the laws their representative would rigorously apply in Buenos Aires parliament. The associated party was called [Partido de la Red](http://partidodelared.org/). They lost in the elections.


#### Evaluation plateform
[Backfeed](http://backfeed.cc/) have developped a (private) evaluation system on top of slack.


#### Decentralized social network
Probably many implementations. Some of them
- [Project groundhog](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/groundhog) have done a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFeJYv3PSaI) explaining their social network.
- [Akasha](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/akasha-project-unveils-decentralized-social-media-network-based-on-ethereum-and-ipfs-1462551273).

#### Decentralized investment platform
[TheDao](https://daohub.org/) is a decentralized plateform for investing money in start-ups.


#### Various web based collaboration platforms
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) is a multi-channel chat.
- [Jira](https://fr.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a collaborative tool for agile project management.
- [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) is an open source (ugly) collaboration plateform which can do a lot.
